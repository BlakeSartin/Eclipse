# Description
Eclipse is a dating and hook up app prioritizing conveniance and user control. Eclipse allows users to make two seperate profiles linked to the same account. One for dating, and one for hook ups. Functionality will allows users to switch between these profiles seemlessly, and the profiles will be independent and private from each other.
The other primary feature of the app, will be functionality that allows users to choose from pre generated, one word descriptions for the dates and hook ups, post meeting. Functionality will be put in place to track these descripters, and when they are used a set ammount of times for the same profile, they will become permanent. This will allow users to be more specific when choosing potential partners.
